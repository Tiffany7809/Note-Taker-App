  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This application allows a user to add custom notes to a list of notes and view them on demand.

  This application is meant to help the user organize their tasks/notes.. 

  .

  Through making this project, I got to learn how to use Heroku to deploy the application, and how to use express.js in my server to build a backend..

  At first, I had a hard time understanding how to use the GET / POST routes, but through trial and error along with lots of reading documentation I was able to gain a better understanding..
